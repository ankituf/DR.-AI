# Dr. AI
This is our hackathon project for ArchHacks 2016. We were initially working on a hardware project that was scrapped after realizing that we didn't have a couple of pieces of important hardware. So we created Dr. AI in the last 10 hours.

## So what is Dr. AI?
Dr. AI aims to reduce the noise and clutter in YOUR visits to the Doctor. We are using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques/APIs to help sick patients get diagnosed from the comfort of their home. Dr. AI is a chatbot that will take your particulars and symptoms and connect you with a real doctor that will use our pre-calculated diagnosis to quickly and accurately diagnose you. If necessary, the doctor might also recommend the patient to visit a doctor in-person or a pharmacy with a prescription. For this, we identify the users' location and suggest the 5 best doctors in the vicinity according to the diagnosis. 

Currently, we have a bot that diagnoses a patient based on the personal details and symptoms. 

## Working Functionality
1. Talk to a Nurse Bot
2. Initial Diagnosis based on the symptoms
3. Probability of the diagnosis
4. Best recommended doctors in the area

## Future Work
1. We are currently working on an interactive app/web application (with GUI).
2. Create a real-time chat application that connects patients with doctors directly after diagnosis.
3. Incorporate our bot to handle mundane/standard work (i.e. collecting particulars/symptoms, passing info to doctor).
4. Come up with list of nearby pharmacies for the user.
5. Greatly improve accuracy of diagnosis prediction.
6. Create a prescription delivery system where patient can get medicine delivered to them.
7. Create a database of the patients for a smoother user experience.

For the best user-experience and more accurate diagnosis we strongly recommend you to follow the following steps while interacting with the Nurse bot.
